Developed a text-based implementation of a No-Limit Hold'em poker game, featuring a Deep Q-Learning agent trained and tested within the environment.

The project includes the comprehensive implementation of fundamental game mechanics essential for Heads-Up (2-player) NLHE poker. This includes the implementation of player actions such as betting, checking, and raising, as well as the delineation of game phases such as pre-flop, flop, turn, and river. Additionally, a hand-ranking mechanism was integrated to compare and evaluate two sets of 7-card holdings, based on the optimal 5-card combination.

The user interface, designed for ease of interaction, allows players to execute various actions, including calling, folding, and raising.

Moreover, a Deep Q-Learning agent was developed using PyTorch. This agent was trained and tested against a baseline AI opponent that plays random moves and bet sizes.
